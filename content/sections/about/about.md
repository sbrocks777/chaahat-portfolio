ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with over a year of experience in various technologies. Let me introduce myself:

## My Journey

- **.NET Enthusiast**: I've worked extensively with both **.NET Core** and **.NET Framework**, building robust and scalable applications. Whether it's web APIs, desktop applications, or cloud services, I thrive on turning ideas into code.

- **Web Development**: I've dabbled in the world of web development, creating responsive and dynamic websites using **MVC**, **React**, and good ol' **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**. From front-end magic to back-end logic, I love the full-stack experience.

- **Desktop Apps**: Remember those days when Windows Forms (**WinForms**) and **WPF** ruled the desktop? Well, I've breathed life into many desktop apps, making them user-friendly and efficient.

- **Database Wizardry**: I've tamed databasesâ€”both **SQL** and **MongoDB**. Whether it's designing schemas, optimizing queries, or ensuring data integrity, I've got it covered.

- **Node.js Adventurer**: I've ventured into the land of **Node.js**, building APIs, real-time applications, and exploring the vast npm ecosystem. JavaScript on the server? Yes, please!
